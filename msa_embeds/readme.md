Plots related to the MSA embeddings-based features.

- vs_interaction_label : plotted against the PepPI interaction label (Positive/Negative)
- vs_success : plotted against the TP, FP, TN, FN of the transfer prediction (of the best model applied on inference over the entire dataset)
- vs_task_solo_feature : plotted against the values of the best single feature for transfer prediction, median_ranks_multimer (i.e the reproduction of Wallner's method)
