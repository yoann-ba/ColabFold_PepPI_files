- Wallner db : the original files downloaded from Wallner's paper + the (id, sequence) database I made and used
- first_compute_161_features_622_complexes.csv : the confidence- and distance-based features computed over every complex
- all_msa_embedding_features_dict.npy : the MSA embeddings-based features computed over every complex (pre-tSNE, so a 256 length vector for each feature)
