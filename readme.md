## Abstract

ColabFold 1.5, based on AlphaFold-Multimer v3, allows for fast and precise transfer to prediction of Peptide-Protein Interactions, with 98% average Precision for 48% average Recall with only 2 seeds. Many features are tested, based both on confidence metrics and the distogram, as well as simple ML models. A transfer confidence metric is studied to support the transfer task. Features are also created on the MSA embeddings to test their use for data clustering, notably finding that a sequence-analog peptide-protein split still persists at the end of the AlphaFold pipeline.

## Repo structure

- data : input sequences, transfer features .csv, MSA embeddings features .npy
- notebooks : the notebooks used (I started using Colab due to CF's GPU VRAM cost, then had to for a moment due to my PC having issues, and then decided to keep going with full Colab until the end. I don't quite recommand doing a full project like this, I'm glad to be back on my local spyder now.)
- paper_figures : full size resolution of the images in the paper
- solo_features_distribution : data distribution plot for each transfer feature
- solo_features_result : confidence plot, ROC curve and PRC for each transfer feature (used as a model with the decision threshold calibration)
- msa_embeds : all the tSNE plots based on the features built on the MSA embeddings
